# node-cp


A better `cp`, ig

literally made this cause i didnt like having to copy everything individually when i wanted to avoid copying something, so its basically a .gitignore for cp

cant confirm that it wont mess up something, so its not my fault if you decide to use it to backup your system and it breaks or something like that

just set up a .cpignore with the folders and files you dont want copied, it doesnt support wildcards yet
